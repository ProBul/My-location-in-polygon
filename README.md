# My-location-in-polygon

This is a small project i finished to determine if the user`s location is located inside a given polygon or outside. 
If the user location is outside the polygon, then the app will calculate the nearest point on the polygon 
(edges and vertex) and show the user the distance to that point.

The app works with locally stored KML file (assets dir) or will get the content of a file stored online.
